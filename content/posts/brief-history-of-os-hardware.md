The article show a brief (and incomplete) history of advancement in hardwares (CPU, Memory, Disk) and Operating System (Linux). The list is sorted in time, and organized into 3 periods: ; without any particular meaning. For each item, we provide reference on the first paper/release, a link to, and related paper, article, blog posts.

Notes:

- The year mentioned could be first commercial release dates
- Once a new technology is introduced, it usually will be follow up by many improvements. The article does not try to include all of them.

If you have any suggestion, feel free to do so in the comment box.
