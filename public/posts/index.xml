      <title>Heat Up Your Laptop Efficiently</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: As &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18r8upf/heat_up_your_laptop_efficiently/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many in Reddit point out&lt;/a&gt;, majority of energy will be converted to heat anyway, so the idea that some instructions can emit more heat while using less power does not make sense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number should still be correct to my knowledge, but the temperature differences should be just be due to different area in the chip heating up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a long-haul flight, nestled in your seat with your laptop, only to find that the chilly cabin air is making it impossible to sleep? With no access to a charging outlet, and your laptop&amp;rsquo;s battery life is limited, you are indeed in a desperate situation. In this article, we will explore an efficient way to heat up your laptop while minimizing power usage, ensuring that you stay cozy throughout the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tool can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hgminh95/heat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving Project Euler 820 on different hardwares (part 1)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://projecteuler.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. Though the problem is more on figuring out the mathematical insight, this post will focus on the engineering side. We are going to look at problem &lt;a href=&#34;https://projecteuler.net/problem=820&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#820&lt;/a&gt;, and try to solve it on various kinds of hardwares, ranging from CPU to FPGA, to see how much speed gains we can get from engineering alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it is fun to see how different hardware affects on performance of the same codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the source code is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hgminh95/euler820&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part 1 of a 2-part series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Assembly for C&#43;&#43; developers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick post on how to read assembly quickly as C++ developer. Note that this is NOT a guide on how to read assembly code. Rather, this post shows how common C++ constructs/routines are compiled into assembly. From there, it can help you to read asm faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which Loop Is Faster?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first loop accesses the memory sequentially from the beginning to the end of the array. The second one skips N steps between 2 iterations. &lt;strong&gt;Which one is faster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
